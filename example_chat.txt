We don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end
Nothing can come between
You and I
Not even the Gods above
Can separate the two of us
No, nothing can come between
You and I
Oh, you and I
I figured it out
Saw the mistakes of up and down
Meet in the middle
There's always room for common ground
I see what it's like
I see what it's like for day and night
Never together
'Cause they see things in a different light
Like us, but they never tried
Like us
You and I
We don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end
Nothing can come between
You and I
Not even the Gods above
Can separate the two of us (Two of us)
'Cause you and I
We don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end
Nothing can come between
You and I
Not even the Gods above
Can separate the two of us
No, nothing can come between
You and I, you and I
Oh, you and I
Oh, you and I
We can make it if we try
You and I
Oh, you and I

12/27/19, 12:13 PM - Amogha Srinivas: While writing a date in the upcoming year 2020, we should write in its full format, e.g. 31/01/2020 and not as 31/01/20., bcoz anyone can change it to 31/01/2000 or 31/01/2019 or in between any year to suit his convenience.

So be cautious about this. Don't write and also don't accept it in any documents, lest it could lose its importance.

This problem will persist only during the year 2020.

3/22/20, 7:11 PM - Aditi Chakravarthy: Idc
3/22/20, 7:12 PM - Kishore: Nvm ill put it here
3/22/20, 7:12 PM - Kishore: Its just human nature and they didn’t do it intentionally it was bcuz during a crisis to maintain economic balance and to make sure the Chinese people didn’t suffer from poverty a law was passed by the Chinese govt during that time of crisis and the farmers had no other option since the law allowed domesticating and breeding various animals they did that for the sake of their families. There are various viruses living in animals it was just a mere one in a million coincidence that someguy ate the wrong animal(a Bat, maybe he thought it’ll turn him into batman we’ll never know😅) at the wrong time the virus migrated to humans 🤷🏻‍♂️ he wouldn’t have done it intentionally and also thre are so many cultures in the world who feed in various animals and stuff its in their culture and been going on from centuries so they technically “don’t deserve this” at least thats my opinion hey, everyone has their own opinion🤷🏻‍♂️
3/22/20, 7:12 PM - Aditi Chakravarthy: Seee rather crabs chicken is fyn ayta
3/22/20, 7:12 PM - Aditi Chakravarthy: Rat bat cockroach

3/22/20, 7:32 PM - Kishore: The animal they ate had tht virus if it didn’t have no one would have complained about eating all those stuff

I didn't know that option was there
12/25/21, 11:08 PM - Abhishek: @919535429259 Don't you dare try to be an insider ever again, you're just making it difficult and uncomfortable for everyone to talk to each other in this group because we know it's gonna reach them through you.There's a reason why no one wanted them in the group and your actions are just nullifying that.
Learn to be nice to people and respect people, especially those with whom you often travel, thanks to them we're being so considerate and nice to you.
You be a simp or do whatever the fuck you want, no one cares just don't jeopardize the bond everyone shares here with each other
12/25/21, 11:09 PM - Majgi: Lmao i love this
12/25/21, 11:09 PM - Majgi: You did your home work well!
12/25/21, 11:34 PM - Abhishek: In some groups the longer they stay together, their friendship ages like vine and with you here, you're just gonna whine and whine
and I'm really tired , all of us are.
12/25/21, 11:34 PM - Abhishek: Please show some respect to vineeth, he's the only reason anyone's been nice to you here

6/21/22, 5:40 PM - Abhishek: Sorry e
6/21/22, 5:41 PM - Abhinandan Nayak: Abhishek if you didn't understand everyone is becoming flirtatious, wild and what not under my influence

6/21/22, 8:48 PM - Abhinandan Nayak: Abhinandan
Verb -ahh bee nan dan

6/21/22, 8:50 PM - Skanda: Meaning shd be a little different though
